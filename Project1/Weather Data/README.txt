Weather Data was compiled using this source: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0

Data was queried from the available dates within the Citi Bike NYC data set.

The edited version of the data removes the copyright for ease of reading and manipulating data.

In addition, the edited version has no whitespace other than linebreaks, again for ease of reading into a python object.
