    "***Describe the purpose of the data set you selected***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set selected by our group for this lab primarily consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. That being said, our team was able to derive <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> more attributes from the original 15 as disussed in detail in the next section. Of particular note, however, we merged NYC weather data from the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0) with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rental behavior as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, we expect to be able to predict whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, etc. Deeper analysis may even yield further insights, such as identifying gaps in station location, for example. Furthermore, quantifiable predictions such as a rider's age as a function of trip distance and duration given other factors would provide improved targeting to bike share marketing efforts in New York City. Likewise, trip duration could be predicted based on other attributes which would allow the company to promote recreational cycling via factor adjustments within its control. By leveraging some of the vast number of trip observations as training data and others as test data via randomized selection, we expect to be able to measure the effectiveness of our algorithms and models throughout the semester."
