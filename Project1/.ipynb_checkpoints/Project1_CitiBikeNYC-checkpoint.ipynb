    "***Describe the purpose of the data set you selected***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set selected by our group for this lab primarily consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to 5562293 trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. That being said, our team was able to derive 15 more attributes from the original 15 as disussed in detail in the next section. Of particular note, however, we merged NYC weather data from the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0) with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rental behavior as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among 330 of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, we expect to be able to predict whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, etc. Deeper analysis may even yield further insights, such as identifying gaps in station location, for example. Furthermore, quantifiable predictions such as a rider's age as a function of trip distance and duration given other factors would provide improved targeting to bike share marketing efforts in New York City. Likewise, trip duration could be predicted based on other attributes which would allow the company to promote recreational cycling via factor adjustments within its control. By leveraging some of the vast number of trip observations as training data and others as test data via randomized selection, we expect to be able to measure the effectiveness of our algorithms and models throughout the semester."

    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "***Describe the meaning and type of data***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into each attribute in detail, one glaring facet of this data set that needs mentioning is its inherent time-series nature. By no means was this overlooked when we decided upon these particular data. To mitigate the effects of time on our analysis results, we have chosen to aggregate time-centric attributes such as dates and hours of the day by replacing them with simply the day of the week or period of the day (more on these details shortly). For example, by identifying trips occurring on July 1st, 2013, not by the date of occurrence but rather the day of the week, Monday, and identifying trips on July 2nd, 2013, as occurring on Tuesday, we will be able to obtain a \"big picture\" understanding of trends by day of the week instead of at the date-by-date level. We understand this is not a perfect solution since the time-series component is still an underlying factor in trip activity, but it is good enough to answer the types of questions we hope to target as described in the previous section as we will be comparing all Mondays against all Tuesdays, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the original data set ***from Citi Bike*** included 15 attributes. These 15 attributes and associated descriptions are provided below:\n",
    "1. **tripduration** - *Integer* - The total time (in seconds) a bike remains checked out, beginning with the start time and ending with the stop time\n",
    "2. **starttime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked out, marking the start of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "3. **stoptime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked back in, marking the end of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "4. **start_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station from which a bike is checked out\n",
    "5. **start_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station from which a bike is checked out; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "6. **start_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "7. **start_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "8. **end_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station in which a bike is checked in\n",
    "9. **end_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station at which a bike is checked in; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "10. **end_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "11. **end_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "12. **bikeid** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify a particular bike; each bike in the bike share network has its own unique number\n",
    "13. **usertype** - *String* - A classifier attribute identifying a rider as a bike share subscriber or a one-time customer (i.e. Subscriber vs. Customer)\n",
    "14. **birth_year** - *Integer* - The year a rider was born (Only available for subscribed riders, however)\n",
    "15. **gender** - *String* - A categorical number value representing a rider's gender (i.e. 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that birth year and gender details are not available for \"Customer\" user types but rather for \"Subscriber\" riders only. Fortunately, these are the only missing data values among all trips in the data set. Unfortunately, however, it means that we will not be able to identify the ratio of males-to-females that are not subscribed or use age to predict subcribers vs. non-subscribers (Customers). More to this end will be discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that while attributes such as trip duration, start and end stations, bike ID, and basic rider details were collected and shared with the general public, care was taken by Citi Bike to remove trips taken by staff during system service appointments and inspections, trips to or from \"test\" stations which were employed during the data set's timeframe, and trips lasting less than 60 seconds which could indicate false checkout or re-docking efforts during checkin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some attributes may be deemed as duplicates (i.e. start_station_id, start_station_name, and start_station_latitude/longitude for identifying station locations), we chose to extract further attributes from the base attributes at hand. Further attributes were also extracted to mitigate the effects of time. In addition, we felt increased understanding could be obtained from combining weather data for the various trips as discussed in the previous section. These additional 10 attributes are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **LinearDistance** - *Integer* - The distance (miles) from a start station to an end station (as a crow flies); calculated from the latitude/longitude coordinates of start/end stations\n",
    "17. **DayOfWeek** - *String* - The day of the week a trip occurs regardless of time of day, month, etc.; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)\n",
    "18. **TimeOfDay** - *String* - The portion of the day during which a bike was checked out; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night)\n",
    "19. **HolidayFlag** - *String* - A categorical binary value used to identify whether the day a trip occurred was on a holiday or not; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. 0 = Non-Holiday, 1 = Holiday)\n",
    "20. **Age** - *Integer* - The age of a rider at the time of a trip; calculated based on the *birth_year* attribute (Since only birth year is included in original Citi Bike data set, exact age at time of trip when considering birth month is not possible)\n",
    "21. **PRCP** - *Float* - The total recorded rainfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "22. **SNOW** - *Float* - The total recorded snowfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "23. **TAVE** - *Integer* - The average temperature throughout the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "24. **TMAX** - *Integer* - The maximum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "25. **TMIN** - *Integer* - The minimum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting our own attributes and merging weather data, the total number of attributes present in our final data set is 25. Only 15 are used throughout this lab, however, due to the duplicate nature of some attributes as discussed already. This final list of ***used*** attributes are tripduration, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, HolidayFlag, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, usertype, gender, Age, PRCP, SNOW, TAVE, TMAX, and TMIN."

    "##### Compiling Multiple Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our analysis, we need to load the data from our source .csv files. Steps taken to pull data from the various source files are as follows:\n",
    "- For each file from CitiBike, we process each line appending manually computed columns [LinearDistance, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, & HolidayFlag]. \n",
    "- Similarly, we load our weather data .csv file.\n",
    "- With both source file variables gathered, we append the weather data to our CitiBike data by matching on the date.\n",
    "- To avoid a 2 hour run-time in our analysis every execution, we load the final version of the data into .CSV files. Each file consists of 250000 records to reduce file size for GitHub loads.\n",

    "Accounting for missing data is a crucial part of our analysis. At first glance, it is very apparent that we have a large amount of missing data in the Gender and Birth Year attributes from our source CitiBike Data. We have already had to handle for missing Birth Year attributes while computing \"Age\" in our Data Load from CSV section of this paper. This was done to create a DEFAULT value of (0), such that future computations do not result in NA values as well. Gender has also already accounted for missing values with a default value of (0) by the source data. Although we have handled these missing values with a default, we want to ensure that we 'need' these records for further analysis - or if we may remove them from the dataset. Below you will see a table showing the frequency of missing values(or forced default values) by usertype. We noticed that of the 4881384 Subscribing Members in our dataset, only 295 of them were missing Gender information, whereas out of the  680909 Customer Users (Non-Subscribing), there was only one observation where we had complete information for both Gender and Birth Year. This quickly told us that removing records with missing values is NOT an option, since we would lose data for our entire Customer Usertype. These attributes, as well as Age (Computed from birth year) will serve as difficult for use in a classification model attempting to predict usertype. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also looked at all other attributes, and verified that there are no additional missing values in our dataset. A missing value matrix was produced to identify if there were any gaps in our data across all attributes. Due to the conclusive results in our data, no missing values present, we removed this lackluster visualization from the report."

    "As discussed previously, we do not have complete coverage in our dataset of gender values. Nevertheless, we are interested to know if there are significant differences between male and female bikers. Since the majority of customers (i.e. non-subscribers) do not provide CitiBike with gender details, this research is indicative mainly for subscribing members. We chose to first build a violin plot with the day of week on the x-axis and log trip duration on the y axis. We broke down the data into two separate violins per day for male vs. female results. As discussed earlier, we see consistencies in trip duration from day to day in both male and female bikers. Interestingly females, in general, have ridden for longer durations than males. One could speculate that this could be due to additional excursions (e.g. shopping, events, etc.), or slower biking speeds during the trip. "

This time, we chose to plot day of week on the x-axis and LinearDistance on the y-axis. This yielded much less insightful information, as \"linear distance\" is not indicative of the actual \"trip distance\". The plotted linear distances appear to be fairly consistent both from day to day (as discussed previously), and between males and females. Further research and / or more insightful data points, such as \"trip distance\", or \"average trip speed\" could help gain further insights.

Again, the time of day attribute is a categorical variable with a group assigned to a ride depending on which range of hours throughout the day the bike ride begins.

The raw data accentuates the true differences from day-to-day and across time slots. Because the raw data is strongly left-skewed, the median value from each day-time grouping was obtained and rendered in the plot. By stacking the median trip durations for each time slot for each respective day, we are able to better understand the time slot proportionality differences across each day of the week. Stacking the time slot median trip durations also provides a total sum of the time slot medians for each day, making it easier compare overall activity for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlating with the \"Box Plot for Log Trip Duration by Day of the Week\" visualization above, trip duration activity does increase on the weekends. Not only that, but hovering over each day bar reveals that Midday, Afternoon, and Evening activity are noticeably higher on Saturdays and Sundays than they are on weekdays whereas Morning and Night activity is relatively consistent. Understanding these trends may help us understand rider intent throughout the week and how it affects their decision to subscribe to Citi Bike or not. Being cognisant of these trends may also improve inventory at some stations at peaks times of the day when also considering start and end location frequency."

    "##### Contour Plot for Log Trip Duration with Respect to Age\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team was interested in the correlation between the Log of Trip Duration and Age. To accomplish this, we decided to produce a joint density correlation plot between the log trip duration and Age. Once again, due to missing \"birth year\" data in our customer (non-subscribing) users - these insights are slightly skewed in terms of interpreting a pearson's r value produced by the correlation plot. Further computations, only on the dataset for those observations that do not contain an age of zero, provide a pearson's R value of .048. This is a very low positive correlation, confirming what is seen visually in the joint plot, with very little change in trip duration as rider age increases. What was interesting to see was the difference between the Age = 0 density rings, vs. the rest of the dataset. As was discussed previously, Age = 0 records mainly consist of customer (non-subscribing) users - thus we can see that the majority of trip durations for customers is greater than that of subscribing users. This is discussed in more detail later in the paper, but one could infer that this is possibly due to subscriber usage via routine trips vs. customer usage via events, trails, etc. Finally, we can easily see via the core density ring areas that the majority of trips by subscribing members are taken by individuals between ~25-35 years old and ~518 seconds (e^6.25). This matched our suspected core member age demographic, as these are likely working individuals in good physical condition for consistent riding."

    "##### HeatMap of TripDuration by Day of Week and Time of Day\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have previously analyzed plots for both day of week and time of day trip durations, we were interested in further exploring in a different light the median trip duration values within specific days and / or time of days groupings. To do this, we produced a HeatMap of Median Trip Duration raw values (Median within Time of Day and Day of Week Groupings) with Time of Day (Ordered Morning - Night) and Day of Week (Ordered Sun. - Sat.) on the Y Axis. Right off the bat, we see the grouping pair with the largest median trip duration is Saturday Afternoons (2-5PM). Also, we can see that weekend trips are generally longer than weekday trips, with emphasis on Midday - Evening starttimes. Interestingly, we see that consistently, trip durations are higher in the evenings - probably due to travelers using the services after work hours. Most of these results, were what the team expected, and had hoped to see. In general, using median times within groups of [Day of Week, Time of Day] pairs, we observed that evenings and weekends received the largest trip durations, whereas weekday mornings received the lowest trip durations. This information could be useful for Citi Bike, in that they would know which times of day / days of week they needed to focus on driving promotions, events, etc. to increase traffic flow. Also, knowing that trips are generally longer during the weekend, could explain reasons for bike availability concerns. Bike availability is a huge part of this bike share service, and creates a huge impact on travelers satisfaction when bikes aren't available at their closest station.  Combining this information with geocoordinate density maps discussed in this paper could help them support bike station shift services - moving bikes from less travelled areas to heavier travelled areas. This could potentialy help mitigate some availability loss in their service."

    "##### Log Trip Duration with respect to Average Temperature Joint Density Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We were interested in seeing the effect temperature has on trip duration. To achieve this we created a joint density correlation plot between Average Temperature (TAVE) and the Log of Trip Duration (tripdurationLog). Interestingly, we did not see as high of a correlation as expected. With a Pearsons R correlation values of .15, there is a very small positive correlation of increasing trip duration (as depicted by a log transformation) as average temperatre increases. The team expected much more correlation, as we thought that individuals would not enjoy being on a bike during cold weather. We do however, see that the density of trip durations is highest around 75 degrees fahrenheit. This matched our expectations because although durations remained fairly unchanged, the number of trips taken decreased as average temperature decreased. This is also depicted by the skewed distribution shown on the Y axis(right side of plot). Possibly, the reason we did not see as large of a change in trip duration is due to the nature of subscriber usage of the bike share service. It is possible that subscribers use the bike share service for routine travel around the city: grocery trips, work trips, trips to meet friends, etc.. All of these things, if the bike share service is a core means for transportation, have not changed distances due to cold weather, therefore you see the number of riders decrease while keeping durations mostly consistent. Further research on this correlation between subscribers vs.  customers and potentially some surveys to subscribing members could assist with proving this theory. If these insights are true during cold weather months, it could help marketing promotions for the service to working individuals in attempts to increase bike share traffic for routine trips. "
