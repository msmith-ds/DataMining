    "***Describe the purpose of the data set you selected***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set selected by our group for this lab primarily consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. That being said, our team was able to derive <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> more attributes from the original 15 as disussed in detail in the next section. Of particular note, however, we merged NYC weather data from the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0) with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rental behavior as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among <span style=\"color:red\">*####*</span> of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, we expect to be able to predict whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, etc. Deeper analysis may even yield further insights, such as identifying gaps in station location, for example. Furthermore, quantifiable predictions such as a rider's age as a function of trip distance and duration given other factors would provide improved targeting to bike share marketing efforts in New York City. Likewise, trip duration could be predicted based on other attributes which would allow the company to promote recreational cycling via factor adjustments within its control. By leveraging some of the vast number of trip observations as training data and others as test data via randomized selection, we expect to be able to measure the effectiveness of our algorithms and models throughout the semester."

    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "***Describe the meaning and type of data***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into each attribute in detail, one glaring facet of this data set that needs mentioning is its inherent time-series nature. By no means was this overlooked when we decided upon these particular data. To mitigate the effects of time on our analysis results, we have chosen to aggregate time-centric attributes such as dates and hours of the day by replacing them with simply the day of the week or period of the day (more on these details shortly). For example, by identifying trips occurring on July 1st, 2013, not by the date of occurrence but rather the day of the week, Monday, and identifying trips on July 2nd, 2013, as occurring on Tuesday, we will be able to obtain a \"big picture\" understanding of trends by day of the week instead of at the date-by-date level. We understand this is not a perfect solution since the time-series component is still an underlying factor in trip activity, but it is good enough to answer the types of questions we hope to target as described in the previous section as we will be comparing all Mondays against all Tuesdays, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the original data set ***from Citi Bike*** included 15 attributes. These 15 attributes and associated descriptions are provided below:\n",
    "1. **tripduration** - *Integer* - The total time (in seconds) a bike remains checked out, beginning with the start time and ending with the stop time\n",
    "2. **starttime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked out, marking the start of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "3. **stoptime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked back in, marking the end of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "4. **start_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station from which a bike is checked out\n",
    "5. **start_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station from which a bike is checked out; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "6. **start_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "7. **start_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "8. **end_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station in which a bike is checked in\n",
    "9. **end_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station at which a bike is checked in; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "10. **end_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "11. **end_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "12. **bikeid** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify a particular bike; each bike in the bike share network has its own unique number\n",
    "13. **usertype** - *String* - A classifier attribute identifying a rider as a bike share subscriber or a one-time customer (i.e. Subscriber vs. Customer)\n",
    "14. **birth_year** - *Integer* - The year a rider was born (Only available for subscribed riders, however)\n",
    "15. **gender** - *String* - A categorical number value representing a rider's gender (i.e. 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that birth year and gender details are not available for \"Customer\" user types but rather for \"Subscriber\" riders only. Fortunately, these are the only missing data values among all trips in the data set. Unfortunately, however, it means that we will not be able to identify the ratio of males-to-females that are not subscribed or use age to predict subcribers vs. non-subscribers (Customers). More to this end will be discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that while attributes such as trip duration, start and end stations, bike ID, and basic rider details were collected and shared with the general public, care was taken by Citi Bike to remove trips taken by staff during system service appointments and inspections, trips to or from \"test\" stations which were employed during the data set's timeframe, and trips lasting less than 60 seconds which could indicate false checkout or re-docking efforts during checkin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some attributes may be deemed as duplicates (i.e. start_station_id, start_station_name, and start_station_latitude/longitude for identifying station locations), we chose to extract further attributes from the base attributes at hand. Further attributes were also extracted to mitigate the effects of time. In addition, we felt increased understanding could be obtained from combining weather data for the various trips as discussed in the previous section. These additional 10 attributes are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **LinearDistance** - *Integer* - The distance from a start station to an end station (as a crow flies); calculated from the latitude/longitude coordinates of start/end stations\n",
    "17. **DayOfWeek** - *String* - The day of the week a trip occurs regardless of time of day, month, etc.; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)\n",
    "18. **TimeOfDay** - *String* - The portion of the day during which a bike was checked out; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night)\n",
    "19. **HolidayFlag** - *String* - A categorical binary value used to identify whether the day a trip occurred was on a holiday or not; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. 0 = Non-Holiday, 1 = Holiday)\n",
    "20. **Age** - *Integer* - The age of a rider at the time of a trip; calculated based on the *birth_year* attribute (Since only birth year is included in original Citi Bike data set, exact age at time of trip when considering birth month is not possible)\n",
    "21. **PRCP** - *Float* - The total recorded rainfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "22. **SNOW** - *Float* - The total recorded snowfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "23. **TAVE** - *Integer* - The average temperature throughout the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "24. **TMAX** - *Integer* - The maximum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "25. **TMIN** - *Integer* - The minimum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting our own attributes and merging weather data, the total number of attributes present in our final data set is 25. Only <span style=\"color:red\">*19*</span> are used throughout this lab, however, due to the duplicate nature of some attributes as discussed already. <span style=\"color:red\">This final list of ***used*** attributes are tripduration, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, HolidayFlag, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bikeid, usertype, gender, Age, PRCP, SNOW, TAVE, TMAX, and TMIN </span>"
