    "\n",
    "The data set again selected by our group for Lab 2 consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) data collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to 5,562,293 trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. In addition to these 15, our team was able to derive 15 more attributes for use in our classification efforts, some attributes of which are NYC weather data which come from [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0). These data are merged with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rider behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among 330 of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, **our intent in this lab is to: 1)Fit clusters describing both customer and subscriber user types 2) Build a classification model for both customer and subscriber clusters 3) Predict customer clusters for subscriber observations and vice-versa providing a Classification-Ready dataset  for predicting whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, customer/subscriber cluster features, etc., and 4) provide a demonstration on how we would implement/deploy these clusters to a new data entry for use in a classification model real-time.** Due to the exhaustive number of observations in the original data set (5,562,293), a sample of 500,000 is selected to achieve these goals (as described further in the sections below).

    "### Data Understanding 1\n",
    "***Describe the meaning and type of data***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into each attribute in detail, one glaring facet of this data set that needs mentioning is its inherent time-series nature. By no means was this overlooked when we decided upon these particular data. To mitigate the effects of time on our analysis results, we have chosen to aggregate time-centric attributes such as dates and hours of the day by replacing them with simply the day of the week or period of the day (more on these details shortly). For example, by identifying trips occurring on July 1st, 2013, not by the date of occurrence but rather the day of the week, Monday, and identifying trips on July 2nd, 2013, as occurring on Tuesday, we will be able to obtain a \"big picture\" understanding of trends by day of the week instead of at the date-by-date level. We understand this is not a perfect solution since the time-series component is still an underlying factor in trip activity, but it is good enough to answer the types of questions we hope to target as described in the previous section as we will be comparing all Mondays against all Tuesdays, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the original data set ***from Citi Bike*** included 15 attributes. These 15 attributes and associated descriptions are provided below:\n",
    "1. **tripduration** - *Integer* - The total time (in seconds) a bike remains checked out, beginning with the start time and ending with the stop time\n",
    "2. **starttime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked out, marking the start of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "3. **stoptime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked back in, marking the end of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "4. **start_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station from which a bike is checked out\n",
    "5. **start_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station from which a bike is checked out; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "6. **start_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "7. **start_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "8. **end_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station in which a bike is checked in\n",
    "9. **end_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station at which a bike is checked in; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "10. **end_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "11. **end_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "12. **bikeid** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify a particular bike; each bike in the bike share network has its own unique number\n",
    "13. **usertype** - *String* - A classifier attribute identifying a rider as a bike share subscriber or a one-time customer (i.e. Subscriber vs. Customer)\n",
    "14. **birth_year** - *Integer* - The year a rider was born (Only available for subscribed riders, however)\n",
    "15. **gender** - *String* - A categorical number value representing a rider's gender (i.e. 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that birth year and gender details are not available for \"Customer\" user types but rather for \"Subscriber\" riders only. Fortunately, these are the only missing data values among all trips in the data set. Unfortunately, however, it means that we will not be able to identify the ratio of males-to-females that are not subscribed or use age to predict subcribers vs. non-subscribers (Customers). More to this end will be discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that while attributes such as trip duration, start and end stations, bike ID, and basic rider details were collected and shared with the general public, care was taken by Citi Bike to remove trips taken by staff during system service appointments and inspections, trips to or from \"test\" stations which were employed during the data set's timeframe, and trips lasting less than 60 seconds which could indicate false checkout or re-docking efforts during checkin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some attributes may be deemed as duplicates (i.e. start_station_id, start_station_name, and start_station_latitude/longitude for identifying station locations), we chose to extract further attributes from the base attributes at hand. Further attributes were also extracted to mitigate the effects of time. In addition, we felt increased understanding could be obtained from combining weather data for the various trips as discussed in the previous section. These additional 10 attributes are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **LinearDistance** - *Integer* - The distance (miles) from a start station to an end station (as a crow flies); calculated from the latitude/longitude coordinates of start/end stations\n",
    "17. **DayOfWeek** - *String* - The day of the week a trip occurs regardless of time of day, month, etc.; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)\n",
    "18. **TimeOfDay** - *String* - The portion of the day during which a bike was checked out; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night)\n",
    "19. **HolidayFlag** - *String* - A categorical binary value used to identify whether the day a trip occurred was on a holiday or not; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. 0 = Non-Holiday, 1 = Holiday)\n",
    "20. **Age** - *Integer* - The age of a rider at the time of a trip; calculated based on the *birth_year* attribute (Since only birth year is included in original Citi Bike data set, exact age at time of trip when considering birth month is not possible)\n",
    "21. **PRCP** - *Float* - The total recorded rainfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "22. **SNOW** - *Float* - The total recorded snowfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "23. **TAVE** - *Integer* - The average temperature throughout the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "24. **TMAX** - *Integer* - The maximum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "25. **TMIN** - *Integer* - The minimum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting our own attributes and merging weather data, the total number of attributes present in our final data set is 25. Only 15 are used throughout this lab, however, due to the duplicate nature of some attributes as discussed already. This final list of ***used*** attributes are tripduration, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, HolidayFlag, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, usertype, gender, Age, PRCP, SNOW, TAVE, TMAX, and TMIN."

    "##### Compiling Multiple Data Sources\n",
    "To begin our analysis, we need to load the data from our source .csv files. Steps taken to pull data from the various source files are as follows:\n",
    "- For each file from CitiBike, we process each line appending manually computed columns [LinearDistance, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, & HolidayFlag]. \n",
    "- Similarly, we load our weather data .csv file.\n",
    "- With both source file variables gathered, we append the weather data to our CitiBike data by matching on the date.\n",
    "- To avoid a 2 hour run-time in our analysis every execution, we load the final version of the data into .CSV files. Each file consists of 250,000 records to reduce file size for GitHub loads.\n",

    "###### Missing Data from Source\n",
    "Accounting for missing data is a crucial part of our analysis. At first glance, it is very apparent that we have a large amount of missing data in the Gender and Birth Year attributes from our source CitiBike Data. We have already had to handle for missing Birth Year attributes while computing \"Age\" in our Data Load from CSV section of this paper. This was done to create a DEFAULT value of (0), such that future computations do not result in NA values as well. Gender has also already accounted for missing values with a default value of (0) by the source data. Although we have handled these missing values with a default, we want to ensure that we 'need' these records for further analysis - or if we may remove them from the dataset. Below you will see a table showing the frequency of missing values(or forced default values) by usertype. We noticed that of the 4,881,384 Subscribing Members in our dataset, only 295 of them were missing Gender information, whereas out of the  680,909 Customer Users (Non-Subscribing), there was only one observation where we had complete information for both Gender and Birth Year. This quickly told us that removing records with missing values is NOT an option, since we would lose data for our entire Customer Usertype. These attributes, as well as Age (Computed from birth year) will serve as difficult for use in a classification model attempting to predict usertype. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also looked at all other attributes, and verified that there are no additional missing values in our dataset. A missing value matrix was produced to identify if there were any gaps in our data across all attributes. Due to the conclusive results in our data, no missing values present, we removed this lackluster visualization from the report."

This time, we broke the dataset into two segments: Customer vs. Subscriber. Below is two separate gmap heatmaps containing geographic densities for each usertype. What we found assisted our theories on customer vs. subscriber usage tendencies. Seen first, the Customer heatmap overall contains much fewer dense regions. This helps to confirm our suspicions infering Customer bikers as less \"routine\" than subscribing bikers. When looking around for the most dense region in this heatmap, one point stuck out as particularly interesting: The Zoo. When comparing this region on the Subscriber gmap, we did not see the same type of traffic! This helps assist our theories that customer bikers use the service more for events, shopping,  or one-time use convenience. On the subscriber gmap, the most dense region, is that near the Grand Central Station as discussed earlier - assisting in the opposing theory for subscribing members as routine trips to work, groceries, etc. as they consistently use the bike share service as a means to reach the metro station."

An alternate explanation, based on what we know in regards to the relationship between trip duration and linear distance traveled, is that subscribers are using the bikes for commuting to and from specific locations. This would result in a lower trip duration than customers that might use their bikes for general travel around the city. This possibility is corroborated by the decrease in activity on the weekends by subscribers.\n",

When later comparing these clusterings between each user class, we will be able to further classify one user type's data against the opposite user type's cluster IDs. This, and its implementation, will be described in much greater detail in the Deployment section.

The *getGraph* function simply generates a k-neighbors graph of the data in order to plot potential *eps* values based on a prescribed minimum number of samples to be used in the DBSCAN algorithm. Next, the *epsPlot* function plots these potential *eps* values. Finally, our *dbs* function clusters the data based on prescribed *eps* and minimum number of samples parameters. Because we plan to plot the clusters against station locations, we adopted and modified a couple functions from this [Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8671808/matplotlib-avoiding-overlapping-datapoints-in-a-scatter-dot-beeswarm-plot) to jitter our data points while depicting a scatterplot.

Due to the multi-dimensionality of our data, and the fact that we have 250,000 observations in our customer data set, it is difficult to define an appropriate mininum number of samples through visual inspection of the data. Therefore, we have chosen a preliminary sample count of 200 from which we will identify an eps value to use as our initial starting point.\n",

To determine a good starting point, we identify a point where the distance starts to increase (looking for an inflection point upward). This is a bit challenging given the plotted results, but, again, this is only a starting point for our permutations. The arguable point identified in this case is at an eps value of about 0.5. This will be our starting value used in our first customer DBSCAN permutation."

    "The final clustering method we will apply to our data set is Spectral Clustering. Due to the multi-dimensional state of our data, our expectation is that spectral clustering will outperform K-means and DBSCAN clustering as it does not rely on distance measures but rather node connectivity. Another expected advantage to using Spectral Clustering is that it allows us to reduce the dimensionality of our data by clustering the data's first two Laplacian matrix eigenvectors only instead of all 22 attributes. As such, it does require a bit more data prep before clustering such as computing Similarity and Affinity, Degree, and Laplacian matrices, but the anticipated outcome is worth the effort. It is by calculating these Laplacian matrix eigenvectors that we are also able to identify an appropriate number of clusters to feed into the algorithm. Cluster count identification will be revealed and discussed in the Modeling and Evaluation Part 2 - Evaluate and Compare section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Spectral Clustering we chose to use R not only for a change of pace but also because documentation for running the algorithm in R is plentiful and application using R overlapped with one of our group members' projects at work. A similar outcome could have been reached with Python just as well, but integrating R offered a fun, new challenge on our Windows OS machines.\n",

    "After initial attempts to compute similarity matrices for all 250,000 transactions from each user type data set, it became quickly apparent we would need to sub-sample our data further. We discovered that the relationship between sample size and CPU time required to compute the Similarity, Affinity, Degree, and Laplacian matrices is not linear. For example, when random-sampling 500 transcations from each data set, matrix computations took 11 minutes to complete for each data set (22 minutes in total between both data sets). With 1000 samples randomly selected for matrix derivation, however, required CPU runtime significantly increased to 44 minutes per data set (that's 1.5 hours in total between both data sets). Given the significant amount of time spent running our DBSCAN code above, we opted to sample no more than 1000 transactions based on our project schedule. We later address this loss in granularity by predicting the remaining transactions' cluster IDs via classification methods in our Deployment section."

    "We have chosen to assess Weather attributes of Average Temperature and Precipitation against trip duration, to identify interesting trends / features across clusters. In our first view, we plot high elevation in order to focus on the presence of data across clusters in varying weather circumstances. Given the fact that majority of rides are taken during non-rainy days, all three clusters contain dense regions around 0 precipitation and warmer temperatures. The interesting takeaway from this data, identifies the different \"tolerance\" levels of a customer rider. As you move from cluster 1 to cluster 3, you see the tolerance for bad weather (both cold temperatures and high precipitation tolerance) decrease. This may suggest that Customers within cluster 1 are more intense riders. One could speculate that the higher tolerance you have to bad weather as a customer, the more likely you may be to become a subscribing user. The correlation of weather attributes across clusters may be an important factor to identifying our target user segment."

Reviewing the number of clusters alone, customer and subscriber counts were 7 and 11 for K-means, 49 and 36 for DBSCAN, and 3 and 5 clusters respectively for Spectral Clustering. DBSCAN was simply far too inefficient when including all clustering attributes (stations coordinates excluded) and time consuming, especially as the number of clusters produced was decreased. Then, when comparing the results of K-means against Spectral Clustering, clusters produced by Spectral Clustering exhibited the best cluster cohesion. Getting more specific still, implementing our Spectral Clustering algorithms using Nystrom's Method for eigenvector computation produced truly the best clustering results out of all configurations tested, from both a cohesion and resource perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are the ramifications of choosing this Spectral Clustering configuration? The biggest pitfall is that extreme sampling was required in order to make Spectral Clustering possible from a resource perspective. This means clustering for most transactions still remains. In addition to the sampling required, our decision to split the data set back into separate customer and subscriber data sets circumvents our business need to identify would-be/should-be subscribers among customer riders. We recognize the deficiency here but have fabricated a means for mitigating the effects thereof via classification on produced clusters (explored throughout the remainder of this section).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to executing cluster classification for missing values, we will also perform PCA analysis, similar to how we did during Lab 2, using these newly generated groupings. Throughout this additional analysis, we hope to extend description of our results and convey even more compelling findings than we have already throughout *Modeling and Evaluation Parts 1-3*."

In order to fit clusters for the inverse user type, we need to build a classification model that can predict the appropriate cluster with strong confidence. For these models, when focusing on accuracy we’ll primarily use confusion matrices to explore our results alongside accuracy percentiles.\n",

This process will occur through 5 iterations, or folds, to allow us to cross validate our results amongst different test/train combinations. We have utilized a random_state seed equal to the length of the original sampled dataset to ensure reproducible results.  "

In a confusion matrix of predicted results, we find that the most difficult cluster to predict and the cluster causing the most incorrect predictions for other classes is cluster 4. You can see this clearly in the gradient plot below as we have a larger density colors on cluster 4 false positives and incorrect cluster 4 predictions in comparison to other clusters. **Customers:** The customer demographic had much less accurate predictions despite the decrease in number of clusters. We once again see a large range in accuracies, with an average accuracy of 73.713 %. As is seen in the confusion matrix, we pretty consistently guess each cluster correct / incorrectly, and unlike the subscriber cluster set we do not see any potential trend for incorrect predictions off the bat. Although ~73% accuracy is not ideal, it is still more than 2x better than chance(33%), so we are comfortable with moving on with this model for this report.  \n",

Alternatively, the marketing team could receive this information periodically, and implement custom strategies based on industry best practice techniques to this target group.

    "**How often would the model need to be updated?** This model would definitely need to be updated periodically. As the citibike Share service grows, and new locations arrive, the model will need to be updated to account for the new sites. Also, as the population in NYC shifts over time(new businesses, schools, residential, etc.), trends may also fluctuate. These fluctuations will need to be accounted for in the model regularly to keep it up to date with current state NYC. Our recommendation for these updates would be periodic (monthly or quarterly) model fit updates in CitiBike systems to account for these possible changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Data to Collect:\n",
    "* **Event/Restaurant/Retail Data:** Given that we have detailed geocoordinate data and have already demonstrated powerful use of the Google Maps API, it would be possible to incorporate location details surrounding Citi Bike start and stop locations. There is potential for such data to be gathered automatically using API's such as Google's. Having this data would provide further insight into some of the reasons some bike share locations are more popular than others. Such data could even help Citi Bike predict changes in station demand based on changing surroundings and help determine where new stations should be installed.\n",
    "* **Special Events:** Similar to the previous idea, merging other public data based on geophysical coordinates and timeline could introduce other external factors such as the effects of parades, public concerts, festivals, and other events on ride activity for a given day or week. This would help identify/predict abnormal activity in this and future data sets. Additionally, it would provide insight to Citi Bike as to how to better plan and prepare for such events to boost rental count and increase trip duration.\n",
    "* **GPS Enabled Bike Computers:** Though not influenced by the data we have at hand, adding bicycle tracking hardware to each Citi Bike rental would provide substantial value to future data sets. Adding GPS tracking would enable Citi Bike to track specific routes followed by clients and could even aid NYC planners with transportation projects. Having route information means that true distance covered would be available, an attribute that would have far more meaning than our LinearDistance attribute. Incorporating GPS tracking with bike speed would provide insights into individual rider activity. For example, just because a rider's trip duration was 6 hours doesn't mean they actively rode for that amount of time. It is far more likely such a rider would have stopped for an extended period of time at least once during this period of time. Adding GPS and speed data would alleviate these existing gaps.\n",

    "## Exceptional Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The following items were especially challenging during this project, we felt noteworthy to mention:\n",
    "* **High Dimensionality:** Most documentation found for clustering in general is based on 2D or 3D clustering. We wanted to produce clusters that attempted to describe the dataset in full. This produced several challenges when it came to runtimes(single iterations for fitting clusters taking 30 minutes to 3 hours each), and visualizing clusters in a way that made sense for contextual interpretations.    \n",
    "* **Utilization of R in jupyter: ** Only 1 of our 3 team members were able to correctly run rpy2 on their machines for this lab. This produced challenges as we tried to collaborate on work and use objects created from R code downstream in the project. \n",
    "* **Prediction of clusters: ** The rubric for this lab seemed to stop sooner than we thought relevant for a real-world application. We found that most cluster algorithms did not have a \"predict\" type of function. Once clusters were fit, you had the clusters for those observations, but not the cluster for new observations. Given the fact that our spectral clustering was so limited in terms of sample size, we had the majority of our dataset left unclustered. This, in application, would not be very useful. To mitigate this challenge, we decided to build a classification model utilizing random forest in order to train (10 fold) on the fit clusters - to fit a model ready to predict the missing cluster values efficiently for both subscriber and customer observations.\n",
    "* **Identifying the \"Value\" in our Clusters through PCA:** Once clusters were added to the dataset, we did not have peace of mind that the clusters were going to actually add \"value\" to Citibike. Without the time, nor project focus, on building a full classification model on predicting usertype - we still wanted to attempt to validate in some way our claims to valid clusters and uncover further insights in the process. We accomplished this through the utilization of PCA. After identifying the correct principal components within our dataset, we searched through the components looking for our newly added cluster columns. There were several Principal components which included our cluster columns, and two in particular that had 6 of the 8 cluster columns included within the top 15 attributes for the PC loading. This gave us peace of mind, that there was a strong possibility that these cluster columns could add value in a classification model downstream.\n",
    "* **Deployment:** In the last lab, we identified our recommendation for the value, deployment methodology, and frequency of updates for a classification model on usertype. The goals for this model remained the same during this lab, with the addition of our predicted clusters appended to the dataset - and the value added for these new attributes. Although, deployment methodology was identified, our team wanted to go one step further to produce code that could take our implemented data feature additions, transformations, and cluster predictions - and apply them to a new data observation. This code produces output, per our recommended real-time deployment methodology, that identifies all data needed(including cluster predictions) on a new data observation. This was done through utilization of .pkl files after a jupyter environment object reset to prove out the similar \"clean\" environment you may see in a Citibike return terminal and / or application. With these tasks produced, in addition to the classification work produced in the last lab, we feel as though this deployment area code would be close to ready for a production system.\n"
