    "The data set again selected by our group for Lab 2 consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) data collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to 5,562,293 trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. In addition to these 15, our team was able to derive 15 more attributes for use in our classification efforts, some attributes of which are NYC weather data which come from [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0). These data are merged with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rider behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among 330 of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, **our intent in this lab is to: 1) Predict whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, etc., and 2) predict a rider's trip duration as a function of the aforementioned variables.** Due to the exhaustive number of observations in the original data set (5,562,293), a sample of 500,000 is selected to achieve these goals (as described further in the sections below). By leveraging Stratified 10-Fold Cross Validation, we expect to be able to derive dependable and accurate user type and ride duration prediction models for which accuracy and performance will be discussed in detail."

    "### Data Understanding 1\n",
    "***Describe the meaning and type of data***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into each attribute in detail, one glaring facet of this data set that needs mentioning is its inherent time-series nature. By no means was this overlooked when we decided upon these particular data. To mitigate the effects of time on our analysis results, we have chosen to aggregate time-centric attributes such as dates and hours of the day by replacing them with simply the day of the week or period of the day (more on these details shortly). For example, by identifying trips occurring on July 1st, 2013, not by the date of occurrence but rather the day of the week, Monday, and identifying trips on July 2nd, 2013, as occurring on Tuesday, we will be able to obtain a \"big picture\" understanding of trends by day of the week instead of at the date-by-date level. We understand this is not a perfect solution since the time-series component is still an underlying factor in trip activity, but it is good enough to answer the types of questions we hope to target as described in the previous section as we will be comparing all Mondays against all Tuesdays, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the original data set ***from Citi Bike*** included 15 attributes. These 15 attributes and associated descriptions are provided below:\n",
    "1. **tripduration** - *Integer* - The total time (in seconds) a bike remains checked out, beginning with the start time and ending with the stop time\n",
    "2. **starttime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked out, marking the start of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "3. **stoptime** - *DateTime* - The date and time at which a bike was checked back in, marking the end of a trip (i.e. 2/12/2014 8:16)\n",
    "4. **start_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station from which a bike is checked out\n",
    "5. **start_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station from which a bike is checked out; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "6. **start_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "7. **start_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station from which a bike is checked out (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "8. **end_station_id** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify Citi Bike stations, in this case the station in which a bike is checked in\n",
    "9. **end_station_name** - *String* - The name of the station at which a bike is checked in; most often the name of an intersection (i.e. E 39 St & 2 Ave)\n",
    "10. **end_station_latitude** - *Float* - The latitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. 40.74780373)\n",
    "11. **end_station_longitude** - *Float* - The longitude coordinate for the station at which a bike is checked in (i.e. -73.9900262)\n",
    "12. **bikeid** - *String* - A categorical number value used to identify a particular bike; each bike in the bike share network has its own unique number\n",
    "13. **usertype** - *String* - A classifier attribute identifying a rider as a bike share subscriber or a one-time customer (i.e. Subscriber vs. Customer)\n",
    "14. **birth_year** - *Integer* - The year a rider was born (Only available for subscribed riders, however)\n",
    "15. **gender** - *String* - A categorical number value representing a rider's gender (i.e. 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that birth year and gender details are not available for \"Customer\" user types but rather for \"Subscriber\" riders only. Fortunately, these are the only missing data values among all trips in the data set. Unfortunately, however, it means that we will not be able to identify the ratio of males-to-females that are not subscribed or use age to predict subcribers vs. non-subscribers (Customers). More to this end will be discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that while attributes such as trip duration, start and end stations, bike ID, and basic rider details were collected and shared with the general public, care was taken by Citi Bike to remove trips taken by staff during system service appointments and inspections, trips to or from \"test\" stations which were employed during the data set's timeframe, and trips lasting less than 60 seconds which could indicate false checkout or re-docking efforts during checkin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some attributes may be deemed as duplicates (i.e. start_station_id, start_station_name, and start_station_latitude/longitude for identifying station locations), we chose to extract further attributes from the base attributes at hand. Further attributes were also extracted to mitigate the effects of time. In addition, we felt increased understanding could be obtained from combining weather data for the various trips as discussed in the previous section. These additional 10 attributes are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **LinearDistance** - *Integer* - The distance (miles) from a start station to an end station (as a crow flies); calculated from the latitude/longitude coordinates of start/end stations\n",
    "17. **DayOfWeek** - *String* - The day of the week a trip occurs regardless of time of day, month, etc.; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)\n",
    "18. **TimeOfDay** - *String* - The portion of the day during which a bike was checked out; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night)\n",
    "19. **HolidayFlag** - *String* - A categorical binary value used to identify whether the day a trip occurred was on a holiday or not; extracted from the *starttime* attribute (i.e. 0 = Non-Holiday, 1 = Holiday)\n",
    "20. **Age** - *Integer* - The age of a rider at the time of a trip; calculated based on the *birth_year* attribute (Since only birth year is included in original Citi Bike data set, exact age at time of trip when considering birth month is not possible)\n",
    "21. **PRCP** - *Float* - The total recorded rainfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "22. **SNOW** - *Float* - The total recorded snowfall in inches on the day of a trip; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "23. **TAVE** - *Integer* - The average temperature throughout the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "24. **TMAX** - *Integer* - The maximum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "25. **TMIN** - *Integer* - The minimum temperature on the day on which a trip occurs; merged from the CDIAC weather data set\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting our own attributes and merging weather data, the total number of attributes present in our final data set is 25. Only 15 are used throughout this lab, however, due to the duplicate nature of some attributes as discussed already. This final list of ***used*** attributes are tripduration, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, HolidayFlag, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, usertype, gender, Age, PRCP, SNOW, TAVE, TMAX, and TMIN."

    "##### Compiling Multiple Data Sources\n",
    "To begin our analysis, we need to load the data from our source .csv files. Steps taken to pull data from the various source files are as follows:\n",
    "- For each file from CitiBike, we process each line appending manually computed columns [LinearDistance, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, & HolidayFlag]. \n",
    "- Similarly, we load our weather data .csv file.\n",
    "- With both source file variables gathered, we append the weather data to our CitiBike data by matching on the date.\n",
    "- To avoid a 2 hour run-time in our analysis every execution, we load the final version of the data into .CSV files. Each file consists of 250,000 records to reduce file size for GitHub loads.\n",

    "###### Missing Data from Source\n",
    "Accounting for missing data is a crucial part of our analysis. At first glance, it is very apparent that we have a large amount of missing data in the Gender and Birth Year attributes from our source CitiBike Data. We have already had to handle for missing Birth Year attributes while computing \"Age\" in our Data Load from CSV section of this paper. This was done to create a DEFAULT value of (0), such that future computations do not result in NA values as well. Gender has also already accounted for missing values with a default value of (0) by the source data. Although we have handled these missing values with a default, we want to ensure that we 'need' these records for further analysis - or if we may remove them from the dataset. Below you will see a table showing the frequency of missing values(or forced default values) by usertype. We noticed that of the 4,881,384 Subscribing Members in our dataset, only 295 of them were missing Gender information, whereas out of the  680,909 Customer Users (Non-Subscribing), there was only one observation where we had complete information for both Gender and Birth Year. This quickly told us that removing records with missing values is NOT an option, since we would lose data for our entire Customer Usertype. These attributes, as well as Age (Computed from birth year) will serve as difficult for use in a classification model attempting to predict usertype. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also looked at all other attributes, and verified that there are no additional missing values in our dataset. A missing value matrix was produced to identify if there were any gaps in our data across all attributes. Due to the conclusive results in our data, no missing values present, we removed this lackluster visualization from the report."

    "After visualizing the overall dataset locations with a heatmap over NYC, we decided to take the visualization one step further. This time, we broke the dataset into two segments: Customer vs. Subscriber. Below is two separate gmap heatmaps containing geographic densities for each usertype. What we found assisted our theories on customer vs. subscriber usage tendencies. Seen first, the Customer heatmap overall contains much fewer dense regions. This helps to confirm our suspicions infering Customer bikers as less \"routine\" than subscribing bikers. When looking around for the most dense region in this heatmap, one point stuck out as particularly interesting: The Zoo. When comparing this region on the Subscriber gmap, we did not see the same type of traffic! This helps assist our theories that customer bikers use the service more for events, shopping,  or one-time use convenience. On the subscriber gmap, the most dense region, is that near the Grand Central Station as discussed earlier - assisting in the opposing theory for subscribing members as routine trips to work, groceries, etc. as they consistently use the bike share service as a means to reach the metro station."

An alternate explanation, based on what we know in regards to the relationship between trip duration and linear distance traveled, is that subscribers are using the bikes for commuting to and from specific locations. This would result in a lower trip duration than customers that might use their bikes for general travel around the city. This possibility is corroborated by the decrease in activity on the weekends by subscribers.\n",

We proceeded to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset.\n",

When later comparing these clusterings between each user class, we will be able to further classify one user type's data against the opposite user type's cluster IDs. This, and its implementation, will be described in much greater detail in the Deployment section.

    "Before running the DBSCAN algorithm on our customer data set, we would first like to obtain a basic understanding of what types of eps and minimum number of samples to use. Due to the multi-dimensionality of our data, and the fact that we have 250,000 observations in our customer data set, it is difficult to define an appropriate mininum number of samples through visual inspection of the data. Therefore, we have chosen a preliminary sample count of 100 from which we will identify an eps value to use as our initial starting point.\n",

Finally, a confusion matrix is displayed for the last test/train iteration for further interpretation on results. \n",

    "With our tuned parameters identified we may now assess futher insights. The Random Forest Model computes a more successful average accuracy rating of 72.496 %, and an Average Log Loss Value of 9.49958 across all 10 iterations. Once again, plotting our True Positive rate vs. False Positive rate in an ROC curve provides insight depicting consistency across iterations. Our Mean ROC area under the curve for all 10 iterations is 0.80, an improvement from logistic regression. We notice the ROC curve line is slightly further to the top left of the plot - as previously discussed, this is the type of improvement we were looking for! In a confusion matrix of predicted results, we find that we have a true positive rating of 72.272 % for subscriber users, whereas our customer true positive rating is 72.952 %. This provides us with 6762 Customer riders(out of 25,000), which may be flagged as potential targets for conversion marketing to subscribing members. With such an improvement in our true positive subscriber ratings, we have much more confidence in the false positive customer predictions here in comparison to logistic regression results. "

   "source": [
    "## Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### How useful is the model for interested parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "**How is this model useful?** Citibike aims to increase rider subscriptions, but may fear adverts to the wrong people could keep customers from enjoying their services. Our classification model predicting usertype as customer or subscriber allows Citibike to identify those customers who meet the criteria for common subscribing members. The Random Forest Classifier model produced an overall accuracy rating of 72.496 %, and although this may not be extremely optimal for True Positive matches, it does provide us with enough information to make educated decisions on which customers may already be considering converting to a subscribing member. These False Positive Customers, may be targeted leaving all others alone, reducing risk of losing customer traffic in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How would this model be deployed?** This model has the ability to be deployed as real-time predictions, or as a periodic corporate marketing alert if customer email addresses are readily available. Our preference would be a real-time prediction as a customer returns a bike. Upon return, if the model suggests a customer contains subcribing tendencies email alerts, pop-up promotions,etc. may be deployed in order to gain the customer's attention towards subscriber offerings. Alternatively, the marketing team could receive this information periodically, and implement custom strategies based on industry best practice techniques to this target group. This group of individuals are likely more apt to acknowledge these tactics positively, since their usage tendencies already align more closely to that of a subcribing member.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How often would the model need to be updated?** This model would definitely need to be updated periodically. As the citibike Share service grows, and new locations arrive, the model will need to be updated to account for the new sites. Also, as the population in NYC shifts over time(new businesses, schools, residential, etc.), trends may also fluctuate. These fluctuations will need to be accounted for in the model regularly to keep it up to date with current state NYC. Our recommendation for these updates would be periodic (monthly or quarterly) model fit updates in CitiBike systems to account for these possible changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regression\n",
    "**How is this model useful?** One of the known issues with CitiBike rentals is a problem of availability. With this model we can attempt to predict how long a bike would be unavailable once it's rented. With the known features and classifiers, it'd be possible to proactively predict bike availability during the day. Even with a low goodness of fit, the low MSE provided by the model results in the ability to allow CitiBike to anticipate the trip duration for each rental. At the end of the predicted time, it could be assumed by the station that the bike had been relocated to another station (updating otherwise should the bike be returned).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How would this model be deployed?** We built our model using only information that would be available to a station at the point at which a rental is made. Our deployment then, would be best used by the station itself to predict, once the bike is removed, how long the bike would be unavailable. If it reaches a point where a defined percentage of its bikes are calculated to be unavailable all at the same time, the station would be able to alert CitiBike and arrangements could be made to either resupply the station or, as we might suggest, send out automated messages to subscribers noting the station as a \"high reward\" station for returning bikes. This would give CitiBike hours of notice rather than minutes in the even of a high-activity day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How often would the model need to be updated?** As the data set itself is constantly updating, the model could be updated by each station or as an aggregate of all stations in a remote database. Because it's a simple enough model, it could be run on a schedule depending upon the number of observations and the available processing power to stay up to day with current trends. Like the classification models, this would also need to be updated periodically, but likely at a much higher rate, possibly weekly, with less emphasis on historical trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Data to Collect:\n",
    "* **Event/Restaurant/Retail Data:** Given that we have detailed geocoordinate data and have already demonstrated powerful use of the Google Maps API, it would be possible to incorporate location details surrounding Citi Bike start and stop locations. There is potential for such data to be gathered automatically using API's such as Google's. Having this data would provide further insight into some of the reasons some bike share locations are more popular than others. Such data could even help Citi Bike predict changes in station demand based on changing surroundings and help determine where new stations should be installed.\n",
    "* **Special Events:** Similar to the previous idea, merging other public data based on geophysical coordinates and timeline could introduce other external factors such as the effects of parades, public concerts, festivals, and other events on ride activity for a given day or week. This would help identify/predict abnormal activity in this and future data sets. Additionally, it would provide insight to Citi Bike as to how to better plan and prepare for such events to boost rental count and increase trip duration.\n",
    "* **GPS Enabled Bike Computers:** Though not influenced by the data we have at hand, adding bicycle tracking hardware to each Citi Bike rental would provide substantial value to future data sets. Adding GPS tracking would enable Citi Bike to track specific routes followed by clients and could even aid NYC planners with transportation projects. Having route information means that true distance covered would be available, an attribute that would have far more meaning than our LinearDistance attribute. Incorporating GPS tracking with bike speed would provide insights into individual rider activity. For example, just because a rider's trip duration was 6 hours doesn't mean they actively rode for that amount of time. It is far more likely such a rider would have stopped for an extended period of time at least once during this period of time. Adding GPS and speed data would alleviate these existing gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deploying the Chosen Model on new data\n",
    "We have discussed above, what value our model holds, our preferred method of deployment, and frequency of model updates. Below we will walk through the process for prepping a real-time prediction model for deployment, and actually executing model predictions on new data inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prepping the Model for Deployment\n",
    "A key component in deploying our model is the re-use of data transformation and / or Model fit objects created during this process. We need to be able to apply new data into the same constructs listed below, which were utilized in the Testing and Training process:\n",
    "* Compute both cluster attributes, and append to the dataset\n",
    "* Min-Max Scaler?\n",

We hope, however, that our efforts did not go unnoticed given the added time we spent ensuring we utilized and interpreted these tools correctly."
