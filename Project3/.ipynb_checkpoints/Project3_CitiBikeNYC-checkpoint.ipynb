    "### Introduction\n",
    "*** Describe the purpose of the model you are about to build ***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set again selected by our group for Lab 2 consists of [Citi Bike trip history](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) data collected and released by NYC Bike Share, LLC and Jersey Bike Share, LLC under Citi Bike's [NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/data-sharing-policy). Citi Bike is America's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City... 55 neighborhoods in all. As such, our data set's trip history includes all rental transactions conducted within the NYC Citi Bike system from July 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2014. These transactions amount to 5,562,293 trips within this time frame. The original data set includes 15 attributes. In addition to these 15, our team was able to derive 15 more attributes for use in our classification efforts, some attributes of which are NYC weather data which come from [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=prog.climsite_daily.sas&_SERVICE=default&id=305801&_DEBUG=0). These data are merged with the Citi Bike data to provide environmental insights into rider behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trip data was collected via Citi Bike's check-in/check-out system among 330 of its stations in the NYC system as part of its transaction history log. While the non-publicized data likely includes further particulars such as rider payment details, the publicized data is anonymized to protect rider identity while simultaneously offering bike share transportation insights to urban developers, engineers, academics, statisticians, and other interested parties. The CDIAC data, however, was collected by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory for research into global climate change. While basic weather conditions are recorded by CDIAC, as included in our fully merged data set, the organization also measures atmospheric carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gas levels to conduct their research efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team has taken particular interest in this data set as some of our team members enjoy both recreational and commute cycling. By combining basic weather data with Citi Bike's trip data, **our intent in this lab is to: 1) Predict whether riders are more likely to be (or become) Citi Bike subscribers based on ride environmental conditions, the day of the week for his/her trip, trip start and end locations, the general time of day (i.e. morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night) of his/her trip, his/her age and gender, etc., and 2) predict a rider's trip duration as a function of the aforementioned variables.** Due to the exhaustive number of observations in the original data set (5,562,293), a sample of 500,000 is selected to achieve these goals (as described further in the sections below). By leveraging Stratified 10-Fold Cross Validation, we expect to be able to derive dependable and accurate user type and ride duration prediction models for which accuracy and performance will be discussed in detail."

    "### Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compiling Multiple Data Sources\n",
    "To begin our analysis, we need to load the data from our source .csv files. Steps taken to pull data from the various source files are as follows:\n",
    "- For each file from CitiBike, we process each line appending manually computed columns [LinearDistance, DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay, & HolidayFlag]. \n",
    "- Similarly, we load our weather data .csv file.\n",
    "- With both source file variables gathered, we append the weather data to our CitiBike data by matching on the date.\n",
    "- To avoid a 2 hour run-time in our analysis every execution, we load the final version of the data into .CSV files. Each file consists of 250,000 records to reduce file size for GitHub loads.\n",
    "- All above logic is skipped if the file \"Compiled Data/dataset1.csv\" already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will see this process, as well as import/options for needed python modules throughout this analysis."

    "###### Missing Data from Source\n",
    "Accounting for missing data is a crucial part of our analysis. At first glance, it is very apparent that we have a large amount of missing data in the Gender and Birth Year attributes from our source CitiBike Data. We have already had to handle for missing Birth Year attributes while computing \"Age\" in our Data Load from CSV section of this paper. This was done to create a DEFAULT value of (0), such that future computations do not result in NA values as well. Gender has also already accounted for missing values with a default value of (0) by the source data. Although we have handled these missing values with a default, we want to ensure that we 'need' these records for further analysis - or if we may remove them from the dataset. Below you will see a table showing the frequency of missing values(or forced default values) by usertype. We noticed that of the 4,881,384 Subscribing Members in our dataset, only 295 of them were missing Gender information, whereas out of the  680,909 Customer Users (Non-Subscribing), there was only one observation where we had complete information for both Gender and Birth Year. This quickly told us that removing records with missing values is NOT an option, since we would lose data for our entire Customer Usertype. These attributes, as well as Age (Computed from birth year) will serve as difficult for use in a classification model attempting to predict usertype. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also looked at all other attributes, and verified that there are no additional missing values in our dataset. A missing value matrix was produced to identify if there were any gaps in our data across all attributes. Due to the conclusive results in our data, no missing values present, we removed this lackluster visualization from the report."

Our target demographic for this study are those individuals under 65 years of age, given that they are the likely age groups to be in better physical condition for the bike share service.

Note the rate of change in explained variance among the first 14 principal components – the change is rather steep through the 14th component.

    "With our goal being to properly classify users between customers and subscribers, we have a unique opportunity to explore false positives. As mentioned previously, false positives in classifying renters as subscribers gives us a subset of possible targets of conversion from customer to subscriber. In this context, when focusing on accuracy we’ll primarily use confusion matrices to explore our results alongside plotted ROC curves.\n",

    "The matrices will illustrate our subset of false positives and give us an idea of the overall accuracy of the model. While normally accuracy is primarily focused on increasing true positives, with our interest in false positives, we’ll judge our models based on the reduction of false negatives. We’ll make these judgements based on log loss as calculated along the ROC curve plotted out after each regression. While it’s true that log loss penalizes all false classifications, it’s easier to evaluate a model based on it rather than a simple quantification of true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interpreting our ROC curves, sensitivity will be our primary element by which we evaluate our model, rather than specificity, as, like previously mentioned, we don’t want to lose out on false negatives as our use depends on false positives.

While we’ll want the model with the highest adjusted R squared, we’ll place the emphasis in our evaluation on the MSE as we performed a log transform on the linear distance reducing the amount of variance between each observation.\n"

    "1. Logistic Regression\n",

Random Forest was also selected because we expected it to produce the most accurate model among all three of our classifiers. Finally, KNN was selected as our third classifier type since it functions rather differently from the logistic regression and random forest in that it computes distance between records, identifying k nearest neighbors and using the class labels of nearest neighbors to identify unknown record labels. All three classification methods take very different approaches to the same task and should make for some interesting comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is important to note that while we have left our function definitions uncommented for each model type, we have commented out the actual model generation code blocks due to their long run-times. Alternatively, we ran the code before commenting and then embedded the rendered HTML outputs in the cell block following the code for interpretation. This allows us to provide the model code outputs while significantly reducing project development times.*\n",

    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first classifier model built is the logistic regression model. As we would like to test the effects of parameter adjustment on model accuracies for each classification method, we have primarily one parameter in our logistic regression fit that appears appropriate to manipulate for accuracies. We have chosen to manipulate the cost variable (*C*) within our logistic regression analyzing accuracies at {1.0, .01, .05, 5}. This parameter is essentially an inverted regularization strength equal to 1/lambda per scikit-learn class function code (lambda being the actual regularization item). Therefore, the smaller the cost value the stronger the regularization. Calculations show that our best value for cost = 0.01 (mean accuracy across 10 iterations = 0.681886), and that accuracy values were very close and even shifted order between most to least accurate from iteration to iteration. While it may not intuitively make sense up front that the strongest regularization value is best given that a cost value of 1 was best during our mini-lab, it is important to remember that we are now using principal components in our model; the mini-lab used the original, unscaled, CitiBike attributes. Though the change in accuracy is minimal, and maybe even negligible, it appears our principal components inputs benefit slightly from added regularization."

    "After 24 iterations of modifying the above parameters, we land on a final winner based on the highest average Accuracy value across all iterations. Average Accuracy values in our 10 test/train iterations ranged from 66.5216 % from the worst parameter inputs of the Ball_Tree Algorith to a value of 69.5528 % in best tuned KNN Classification model fit. We have chosen to utilize the best input for KD tree, although losing an improvement of .0004 % due to the cost(slower runtime of 07 Minutes 25 Seconds through 10 iterations) of fitting the model as Ball Tree. Parameter inputs for the final K Nearest Neighbor Classification model with the KD Tree Algorithm are as follows:\n",

Average MSE values in our 10 test/train iterations ranged from 0.557855 from the worst parameter inputs of the Ball_Tree Algorith to a value of 0.485734 in best tuned KNN Regression model fit. We have chosen to utilize the best input for KD tree, although losing an improvement of 0.000001 due to the cost(slower runtime of 7 Minutes 38 Seconds through 10 iterations) of fitting the model as Ball Tree. Parameter inputs for the final K Nearest Neighbor Regression model with the KD Tree Algorithm are as follows:\n",

    "Minimum number fo samples required to split a node. Care was taken during parameter tests to keep the ratio between Min Samples in Leaf and Min Samples to Split equal to that of the default values (1:2). This was done to allow an even 50/50 split on nodes which match the lowest granularity split criteria. similar to the min samples in leaf, too low a value here leads to overfitting the tree to train data.\n",

Average MSE values in our 10 test/train iterations ranged from 0.958022 when utilizing defaults for the random splitter algorithm to a value of 0.491977 in our final tuned random splitter Decision Tree model fit.

As described in the article provided information from the \"Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, Second Edition\" textbook, most situations do not need more than one hidden layer - however there is a general rule of thumb to be computed for the number of neurons in that layer. This rule of thumb for computing the number of neurons in a Hidden Layer is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.\n",
    "    * The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer.\n",
    "    * The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to utilized this rule of thumb as a starting place (e.g. 15*(2/3)+1 = 11), when testing inputs for the hidden_layer_sizes parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alpha**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha is utilized as a smoothing parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Size** \n",
    "\n",
    "MLP Regression utilizes stochastic gradient descent with minibatches in its function. As defined in a <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/140811/how-large-should-the-batch-size-be-for-stochastic-gradient-descent\">stackexchange article</a>: \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *~\"The Batch size determines how many examples you look at before making a weight update. The lower it is, the noisier the training signal is going to be, the higher it is, the longer it will take to compute the gradient for each step.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be cognizant of this factor as to obtain reasonable run-times while avoiding high noise in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max Iterations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Iterations defines the maximum number of iterations to process regardless of the optimization tolerance identified. If optimization tolerance threshold is not met sooner than the defined number of max iterations, the training will stop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Learning Rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Initial Learning rate identifies step-size for weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 20 iterations of modifying the above parameters, we land on a final winner based on the lowest average MSE value across all iterations. Average MSE values in our 10 test/train iterations ranged from 0.502850 from the worst parameter inputs to a value of 0.492009 in our final tuned MLP model fit. Parameter inputs for the final MLP model are as follows:\n",

Inputs of PCA components, Model CLF object, original sample data, and a CV containing our test/train splits allow us to easily produce an array of Accuracy Scores, and log_loss values for the different permutations of models tested. A ROC Curve plot is also displayed depicting a stacked view of the ROC_AUC Values for each iteration. Finally, a confusion matrix is displayed for the last test/train iteration for further interpretation on results. "

    "Based on our previously performed parameter input tests above, we would like to dig deeper into additional accuracy metrics as discussed previously. With our final logistic regression model including a cost value of .01, we compute an average accuracy rating of 68.189 %, and an Average Log Loss Value of 10.9871 across all 10 iterations. Plotting our True Positive rate vs. False Positive rate in an ROC curve provides additional insight depicting consistency across iterations. This is a good sign that our test vs train methodology was well established, due to consistent results across varying datasets. Our Mean ROC area under the curve for all 10 iterations is 0.74, leaving much to be desired in terms of true positives as we would like to see the curve reach further to the top left of the plot. However, as discussed previously, our interest lies in the false positives. In a confusion matrix of predicted results, we find that we have a true positive rating of 64.588 % for subscriber users, whereas our customer true positive rating is 72.16 %. This provides us with 6960 Customer riders(out of 25,000), which may be flagged as potential targets for conversion marketing to subscribing members. Ultimately, we would like to find a model with a higher subscriber true positive rating - as this also strengthens the likelihood of strong conversion targets on the false positive customers."

Once again, plotting our True Positive rate vs. False Positive rate in an ROC curve provides insight depicting consistency across iterations. Our Mean ROC area under the curve for all 10 iterations is 0.80, an improvement from logistic regression. We notice the ROC curve line is slightly further to the top left of the plot - as previously discussed, this is the type of improvement we were looking for! In a confusion matrix of predicted results, we find that we have a true positive rating of 72.272 % for subscriber users, whereas our customer true positive rating is 72.952 %. This provides us with 6762 Customer riders(out of 25,000), which may be flagged as potential targets for conversion marketing to subscribing members.

The KNN Model computes an average accuracy rating of 69.554 %, and an Average Log Loss Value of 10.51565 across all 10 iterations. Although these values are slightly more favorable than logistic regression, they are lacking in comparison to the Random Forest Classifier. Once again, plotting our True Positive rate vs. False Positive rate in an ROC curve provides insight depicting consistency across iterations. We are confident that our test/train methodology is sound while using stratified 10 kfold cross validation. Our Mean ROC area under the curve for all 10 iterations is 0.77, an improvement from logistic regression, but once again less favorable than Random Forest. In a confusion matrix of predicted results, we find that we have a true positive rating of 67.464 % for subscriber users, whereas our customer true positive rating is 71.884 %. This provides us with 7029 Customer riders(out of 25,000), which may be flagged as potential targets for conversion marketing to subscribing members. Given knowledge of the previous two models these results are worrysome, as this model produces the largest false positive rating for customers, while still remaining fairly low true positive subscriber rating. Although true positive subscriber rating is higher than that of logistic regression, we will be hesitant with moving forward with this model."

    "Despite the long run-time of this model, the accuracy metrics in this classification model are difficult to dispute. An average accuracy rating of 72.496 %, puts the random forest accuracy rating 2.942 % ahead of the next closest model(KNN). However, as discussed in the analysis section, we are hesitant to utilize KNN due to the fact that it contained the lowest True Positive Customer rating of all models. Given this factor - when comparing to Logistic regression, we find that Random forest correctly predicted 1,945 more subscribing members providing more confidence in the false positive customer predictions as potential targets for conversion. If run-time of this model deems as innapropriate in a live environment, measures could be taken to reduce the n_estimators parameter, as it is a large runtime performance factor. This would of course have implications reducing accuracy of the model fit, but as was discovered during parameter tuning, it is very possible that it could continue to be the top model even with an adjustment on n_estimators.\n",

With our current dataset, we’re leaning heavily on the better numbers for our decision to go with KNN as our final method for modeling our prediction.

Building out a more accurate model using the entirety of the dataset would require keeping an eye on resource needs.

The models whose attributes will be reviewed are our Random Forest Classificatino model and KNN KDTree Regression model.\n",

The ordering if most important to least important continues with largest to smallest feature importance values. While reviewing our random forest input variables' (principal components in this case) coefficient values is helpful, it does not help us contextually understand the significance of our original attributes. For this reason, it is important to follow up with a review and interpretation of our most important principal components' loadings."

Given PC3's large positive coefficient value in the model, it is interesting to see the negative correlation between Saturday rides (-0.58) and Morning rides (0.58). We could hypothesize that if riders are spending their time riding during the morning hours (5am-10am), they are commuting more for work than they are weekend joy riding. Supporting this arguement are the modest positive loadings for the weekdays and the negative loading for Sunday as well. Interestingly enough however, evening, midday, and afternoon rides are also negatively loaded.

Not only are the strong negative temperature loadings interesting, but they are negatively correlated with Saturday and Sunday activity (~0.15 and 0.205 respectively). This might suggest that, for example, as the temperature outside increases, subscriber activity decreases on the weekends but increases weekdays (except Fridays).

This component clearly portrays very large loadings for start and end station latitudes in excess of -0.6 with the next largest loadings being for start/end station longitudes (loadings around -0.25). This means that riders who are subscribers, for example, are more likely to use stations with larger latitudes (further north in the region) and more positive longitudes (further east in the region) than Customers. Based on what we know about the mid and lower Manhattan areas of NYC and what we observed during Lab 1, we can hypothesize that location is indeed important because of the reasons driving riders to use the CitiBike system. In Lab 1, our heatmaps indicated that customer activity wasn't really centralized to any particular region besides a small concentration at the Central Park Zoo station, whereas subscribers exhibited heavy concentrations throughout the mid and Northeast areas of the region. Notable also is that individual stations also exhibit positive and negative loadings corresponding well with the latitude and longitude loadings."

    "\n",
    "#### How useful is the model for interested parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "**How is this model useful?** Citibike aims to increase rider subscriptions, but may fear adverts to the wrong people could keep customers from enjoying their services. Our classification model predicting usertype as customer or subscriber allows Citibike to identify those customers who meet the criteria for common subscribing members. The Random Forest Classifier model produced an overall accuracy rating of 72.496 %, and although this may not be extremely optimal for True Positive matches, it does provide us with enough information to make educated decisions on which customers may already be considering converting to a subscribing member. These False Positive Customers, may be targeted leaving all others alone, reducing risk of losing customer traffic in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How would this model be deployed?** This model has the ability to be deployed as real-time predictions, or as a periodic corporate marketing alert if customer email addresses are readily available. Our preference would be a real-time prediction as a customer returns a bike. Upon return, if the model suggests a customer contains subcribing tendencies email alerts, pop-up promotions,etc. may be deployed in order to gain the customer's attention towards subscriber offerings. Alternatively, the marketing team could receive this information periodically, and implement custom strategies based on industry best practice techniques to this target group. This group of individuals are likely more apt to acknowledge these tactics positively, since their usage tendencies already align more closely to that of a subcribing member.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How often would the model need to be updated?** This model would definitely need to be updated periodically. As the citibike Share service grows, and new locations arrive, the model will need to be updated to account for the new sites. Also, as the population in NYC shifts over time(new businesses, schools, residential, etc.), trends may also fluctuate. These fluctuations will need to be accounted for in the model regularly to keep it up to date with current state NYC. Our recommendation for these updates would be periodic (monthly or quarterly) model fit updates in CitiBike systems to account for these possible changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regression\n",
    "**How is this model useful?** One of the known issues with CitiBike rentals is a problem of availability. With this model we can attempt to predict how long a bike would be unavailable once it's rented. With the known features and classifiers, it'd be possible to proactively predict bike availability during the day. Even with a low goodness of fit, the low MSE provided by the model results in the ability to allow CitiBike to anticipate the trip duration for each rental. At the end of the predicted time, it could be assumed by the station that the bike had been relocated to another station (updating otherwise should the bike be returned).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How would this model be deployed?** We built our model using only information that would be available to a station at the point at which a rental is made. Our deployment then, would be best used by the station itself to predict, once the bike is removed, how long the bike would be unavailable. If it reaches a point where a defined percentage of its bikes are calculated to be unavailable all at the same time, the station would be able to alert CitiBike and arrangements could be made to either resupply the station or, as we might suggest, send out automated messages to subscribers noting the station as a \"high reward\" station for returning bikes. This would give CitiBike hours of notice rather than minutes in the even of a high-activity day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How often would the model need to be updated?** As the data set itself is constantly updating, the model could be updated by each station or as an aggregate of all stations in a remote database. Because it's a simple enough model, it could be run on a schedule depending upon the number of observations and the available processing power to stay up to day with current trends. Like the classification models, this would also need to be updated periodically, but likely at a much higher rate, possibly weekly, with less emphasis on historical trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Data to Collect:\n",
    "* **Event/Restaurant/Retail Data:** Given that we have detailed geocoordinate data and have already demonstrated powerful use of the Google Maps API, it would be possible to incorporate location details surrounding Citi Bike start and stop locations. There is potential for such data to be gathered automatically using API's such as Google's. Having this data would provide further insight into some of the reasons some bike share locations are more popular than others. Such data could even help Citi Bike predict changes in station demand based on changing surroundings and help determine where new stations should be installed.\n",
    "* **Special Events:** Similar to the previous idea, merging other public data based on geophysical coordinates and timeline could introduce other external factors such as the effects of parades, public concerts, festivals, and other events on ride activity for a given day or week. This would help identify/predict abnormal activity in this and future data sets. Additionally, it would provide insight to Citi Bike as to how to better plan and prepare for such events to boost rental count and increase trip duration.\n",
    "* **GPS Enabled Bike Computers:** Though not influenced by the data we have at hand, adding bicycle tracking hardware to each Citi Bike rental would provide substantial value to future data sets. Adding GPS tracking would enable Citi Bike to track specific routes followed by clients and could even aid NYC planners with transportation projects. Having route information means that true distance covered would be available, an attribute that would have far more meaning than our LinearDistance attribute. Incorporating GPS tracking with bike speed would provide insights into individual rider activity. For example, just because a rider's trip duration was 6 hours doesn't mean they actively rode for that amount of time. It is far more likely such a rider would have stopped for an extended period of time at least once during this period of time. Adding GPS and speed data would alleviate these existing gaps."

The additional research and work put toward these records seemed to balloon at times, especially when considering MLP interpretations and ranking attributes through the haze of PCA's linear combinations. We hope, however, that our efforts did not go unnoticed given the added time we spent ensuring we utilized and interpreted these tools correctly."
